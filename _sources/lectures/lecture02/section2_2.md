# Lecture 2.2 - Computer Components

## Motherboard (MB)

A computer cannot exist without a motherboard, muhc like you cannot send signals around your body without a nervous system.

A motherboard is the main circuit board inside a computer that connects the different parts of a computer together. It has sockets for the CPU, RAM and expansion cards (e.g. discrete graphics cards, sound cards, network cards, storage cards etc)... and it also hooks up to hard drives, disc drives and front panel ports with cables and wires. While you have not been introduced to all the different components that plug into a motherboard, this course aims to introduce you to the most popular choices on the market.

## Hard Drives (HD)

As mentioned previously hard drives contain the data of your computer. From lecture 1 you can recall how quickly technology advanced and in a similar sense, data storage advanced as well. The two most common ways to store data on your compter today include hard disk drives and solid state drives.

### Hard Disk Drive

A hard disk drive (HDD) is composed of a platter that contains compartments to hold data. This data is your operating system, applications, and any files you have created. Inside the hard drive there is also an accuator arm that moves across the platter to read or write the information requested. To make this process faster, the platter spins (like a CD/DVD/Blu-ray) as the accuator arm moves across it.

With this type of hard drive, the compartments that hold the data can be spread out all over the hard disk. That is, data is not written sequentially.

### Solid State Drive

This is a solid state drive...

### Data Storage

Data in your phones, computers, and other piece of technology is dicated by bits (B) and bytes (b). This course covers more in-depth topics on the differences of bits and bytes in a future lecture, but mentioning it here as it relates to hard drives is important to remember.

When purchasing hard drives, keep in mind that most hard drive manufactueres advertise their drives in bits. Meaning you can go to a BestBuy or MicroCenter (or online) and you can find hard drives from sizes as small as 256 GB to 18 TB. However when plugged into your computer, it does not read 256 GB and instead reads something smaller. That is because of the bit and byte difference that is explained later.
