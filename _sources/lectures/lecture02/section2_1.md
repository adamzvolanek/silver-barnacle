## Relating the Computer to a Human Body

It is hard to describe a computer to someone who perhaps doesn't know about what a motherboard is, or what a CPU does, but the analogy below is created to help bridge the gap of what each component does and how it can relate to a human body.

### Nervous System & Motherboard

All computer parts are connected to each other on the motherboard. Electrical signals are passed throughout the components, without a motherboard, all other components are lifeless. Similar to our nervous systems, they connect our entire body from fingers to toes.

### Hard Drive & Brain (Subconscious)

All knowledge of programs, files and data is stored on the Hard Drive. Just like the brain, it is sectioned off for various purposes. The hard drive stores and retrieves all of our precious information and programs for use by use whenever we wish. Just like our long term memories.

### CPU & Spinal Cord

A chip that is on the Motherboard that is responsible for processing instructions (commands) received from hard drive (brain). It controls every activities of the computer. Just like the spinal cord, it receives instructions from the brain (hard drive).

### RAM & Brain (Conscious)

RAM is a holding area of files and instructions that are to be used and then forgotten about. It allows the computer to multi-task just as your brainâ€™s conscious thought allows you to multi-task. The more RAM, the better your computer can multi-task, and the faster it will perform.

### Speaker/Printer & Mouth

Both are output devices. They produce what the computer needs to give out.

### Mouse / Keyboard & Hands

Both are input devices. They are used to send in instructions and information into and out of the computer.

### Microphone & Ears

Microphone receives sound waves and sends it into the computer for processing

### Monitor & Face

This is an output device. It has a screen which it uses to display what the computer is doing or how it feels. Just like the human face shows different expressions.

### System Case & Skin

This gives the computer a definite shape. It defines a computer telling us more about it, how it responds to the conditions around. Same implies the human skin, it defines the human body.

#### Related to the human brain
