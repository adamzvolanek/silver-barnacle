# Lecture 2.3 - Building A Computer

## Component Considerations

Building a computer may seem like a complicated task, and in some ways it can be, but here are a few questions to ask yourself before building a computer.

1. **Purpose**: What you will be using the computer for? Gaming, video editing, programming, general use, etc. It would be important to know what you're trying to achieve and what type of software you're planning on running.

2. **Budget**: How much money you are willing to spend on the computer, including components and peripherals. You'll want to set a budget and then work within that budget to select the components that will give you the best value for your money.

3. **Hardware compatibility**: Make sure that all of the components you choose are compatible with each other, in terms of form factor, power requirements and ports. A motherboard for example should match the processor's socket type, memory's clock speed and the GPU's interface.

4. **CPU**: Central Processing Unit, it is the brain of the computer, you should choose a CPU that will be powerful enough to handle the tasks you need to perform.

5. **RAM**: Random Access Memory, it is the memory where the CPU temporarily stores data, having more RAM will improve overall performance, you should choose the amount of RAM that you need for your tasks.

6. **GPU**: Will you need a graphics card to run different software efficiently or gaming?

7. **Storage**: Hard drives and solid state drives (SSD), you'll want to choose a storage solution that will provide you with enough space for your files and programs, and that will be fast enough for your needs.

8. **Cooling**: Consideration for temperature management, the cooling solution for your computer should be able to keep your components running at safe temperatures.

9. **Power supply**: Make sure the power supply can provide enough power for your components and has the proper connectors to match.

10. **Peripherals**: you should consider the peripherals you need such as keyboard, mouse, display, speakers, etc.

11. **Future Upgrade**: Consider if you have any potential future upgrade in mind, such as additional storage, or a more powerful GPU, etc.
