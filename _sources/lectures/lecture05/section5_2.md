## How do computers talk
Binary is the langauge that computer processors use to perform instructions. It is a two symbol system, named binary, comprised of two bits: 0 and 1.

Below you can see how data storage can be showed with this kind of heirarchical tree.
8 bits = 1 byte
1024 bytes = 1 kilobyte
1024 K = 1 Megabyte = 1,048,576 bytes
1024 Mb = 1 Gigabyte = 10,73,741,824 bytes
1024 Gb = 1 Terabyte = 1,099,511,627,776 bytes
1024 Tb = 1 Petabyte = 1,125,899,906,842,624 bytes
1024 Pb = 1 Exabyte = 1,152,921,504,606,846,976 bytes
1024 Eb = 1 Zettabyte = 1,180,591,620,717,411,303,424 bytes
1024 Zb = 1 Yottabyte = 1,208,925,819,614,629,174,706,176 bytes

## Where does it go?
A RAM memory chip stores binary data through billions of capacitors.
