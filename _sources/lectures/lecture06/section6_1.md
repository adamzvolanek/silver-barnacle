# Lecture 6.1 - Where is my Rolodex?

## Windows File Structure

Discuss how windows organizes computer (OS) files, and personal files

### Desktop

The desktop is like your personal workspace. It's where you might keep important files and shortcuts to your favorite programs. Imagine it as the top of your physical desk where you keep things you use frequently.

#### Recycle Bin

Think of the Recycle Bin like a trash can. When you delete a file, it goes into the Recycle Bin. If you decide you didn't mean to delete it, you can restore it from the Recycle Bin.

### My Computer/This PC

"My Computer" or "This PC" is like a map of your filing cabinet. It shows you all the drives (like C: drive, D: drive, etc.) and folders on your computer.
Remember, it's like organizing your schoolwork into different folders and keeping everything in its place. The file structure helps your computer find and organize information, just like your folders help you keep your homework and notes organized in school.

#### C: Drive

The C: drive is like the main drawer in your filing cabinet. It's where the majority of your files and programs are stored. If you open the C: drive, you'll find various folders, just like different sections in that drawer.

#### Users

Inside the C: drive, there's a folder called "Users." This is like having separate sections in the drawer for different people who use the computer. Each user on your computer has their own folder within "Users" to keep their stuff separate.

#### Documents, Pictures, Music, Videos:

Inside your user folder, you have special folders for specific types of files. For example:
"Documents" is where you keep your written work.
"Pictures" is for all your photos and images.
"Music" is where your songs go.
"Videos" is for your video files.

#### Programs

There's a folder called "Program Files" inside your C: drive as well. This is where all your installed programs are stored. Each program has its own folder to keep things organized.

## On ChromeOS

### Google Account

ChromeOS is tightly integrated with Google services. When you log in to a Chromebook, you use your Google Account. This account is like your key to the entire ChromeOS world.

### Files App

Instead of a traditional file explorer, ChromeOS has a "Files" app. It looks like a file explorer but is more focused on cloud storage and web-based applications.

#### No C: Drive or Direct File Paths

Unlike other operating systems, ChromeOS doesn't have a C: drive or direct file paths. It abstracts the traditional file structure to make things simpler for users.

#### Downloads Folder

When you download something, it goes to the "Downloads" folder. It's similar to downloading files on other systems, but ChromeOS encourages you to store and access your files in the cloud.

### Google Drive

Google Drive is a cloud storage service that's central to ChromeOS. It's like a digital backpack where you keep your files. The "My Drive" section is like your personal folder, and you can create additional folders to organize your files.

### Apps and Extensions

Instead of traditional programs, ChromeOS uses web apps and extensions. These are like tools and games you can use directly from the internet. You can access them from the app launcher, which is like a simplified Start Menu.

### Taskbar and Shelf

The bottom of the screen has a taskbar and shelf. This area shows your currently open apps, the time, and other quick settings. It's like a digital desktop.

### Offline Mode

ChromeOS is designed to work seamlessly online, but it also has offline capabilities. Some apps and files can be accessed without an internet connection.

In essence, ChromeOS encourages users to work primarily in the cloud. Files are stored on Google Drive, and applications are web-based. It's a streamlined and secure approach, particularly suitable for users who primarily use web applications and want a straightforward and easy-to-use system.
