# Computing Course 101 <sub>(Codenamed: silver-barnacle)</sub>

This is the lecturebook repository for the course "Computering 101". The course is hybrid where lecture will be held in person however students are welcome to reference the lecturebook online as needed. The lecturebook is comprised of both the structure, layout, and timeline of material to be covered, and any executable code to accompany learning.

## Description

Intended as a volunteer effort to teach middle/high-school students computer literacy and Microsoft Office basics, this repository will be continually updated to best suite current and future student needs. 

## Lecture Book
The link to the lecture book can be found [here](https://adamzvolanek.github.io/silver-barnacle/).

## Getting Started

### Dependencies

* [Git](https://git-scm.com)
* [Python](https://www.python.org)
* [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/)
* [Jupyter-Book](https://jupyterbook.org/en/stable/intro.html)

### Installing Programs
Please use best judgement when downloading installers and programs to your local computer. Recommended items are needed if wanting to build Jupyter-Books with code.

#### Required
* [Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git)
* [Python 3.10.X](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
  * Windows users: WSL may be required
* Your favorite code editor.

#### Recommended
* [JupyterLab Desktop](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab-desktop)
* [Notepad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/) does not support live view of markdown however supports the markdown languge in terms of syntax highlighting.
  * There are many online based markdown editors for use in tandem like [StackEdit](https://stackedit.io/), [Dillinger](https://dillinger.io/), or if you prefer a local installation of [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).

### Executing program

Users are able to make updates to the markdown files using any of the free markdown editors online for their respective operating systems. It is encouraged to use markdown editors and spell-check if possible. Likewise use of Jupyter-book in the event of executable code is required is highly encouraged to ensure compatability during pages deployment.

Once any updates are complete, including new pages in markdown or jupyter-book, commit your changes with an appropriate message and push to the main branch. Once pushed, run the make.sh file in the main branch to compile the jupyter-book, push to the gh-pages branch, and cleanup the main branch there after. This is all done automaticall
